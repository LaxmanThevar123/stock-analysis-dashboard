## How to Use

### Scenario 1: New Global Event
1. Go to "🌍 Global Impact" tab
2. Check "Critical Alerts" section
3. Review affected sectors
4. Identify substitute opportunities
5. Adjust portfolio

### Scenario 2: Commodity Research
1. Select commodity from dropdown
2. Review "Affected Indian Companies"
3. Check "Substitute Materials"
4. View "Substitute Projections" table
5. Note investment ratings

### Scenario 3: Portfolio Risk Check

4. Plan substitute exposure

## Investment Strategy Framework

### Phase 1: Event Occurs (Week 1)
- Monitor news alerts
- Identify affected holdings
- Assess exposure level

### Phase 2: Impact Assessment (Month 1)
- Analyze price impact
- Review company responses
- Check substitute plans

### Phase 3: Positioning (Months 2-3)

- **STRONG BUY**: Immediate substitute, high adoption
- **BUY**: Clear substitute path, 1-2 year timeline
- **ACCUMULATE**: Emerging substitute, 2-3 years
- **HOLD**: Uncertain substitute, >3 years
- **AVOID**: No substitute, high dependency

## Real-Time Updates

## Example Investment Thesis

### Cobalt Crisis → LFP Battery Play

**Thesis**: Congo cobalt restrictions will accelerate LFP adoption in India

**Evidence**:
1. Cobalt prices up 35%
2. LFP 20% cheaper, no cobalt
3. Govt pushing EV adoption
4. Reliance, Exide investing in LFP

**Action**:
- BUY: Exide Industries (LFP production)
- BUY: Reliance (LFP + sodium-ion R&D)
- ACCUMULATE: Tata Motors (LFP EV variants)
- AVOID: High cobalt dependency EVs

**Timeline**: 6-12 months for material impact

**Exit**: When LFP adoption >50% or cobalt supply normalizes
